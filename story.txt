Robert Grindlewalker. We all knew him as Bobby. Bobby was the best
Physic's teacher that Springville High School ever had. We all often wondered
why someone of his intellectual ability was a teaching AP Physics and not 
working towards making a new discovery in the field of Quantum Mechanics.
It was not until his 50th birthday, when he announced that he would retire at
the end of the academic year, did we learn why.
